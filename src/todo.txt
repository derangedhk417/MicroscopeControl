- Use the threshold values in material files
- Document stuff
- Make autofocus attempt to move around and find a better spot
- Move the monolayer contrast calculator code into this repository.
- Implement proper generation of optical parameter files.
- Cleanup image processing code.


Parts:

 - Proper mount for fiber optic at the source
 - C-MOUNT 1"-32 female adapted cage that can mount a dichroic
   - Must have a male C-MOUNT 1"-32 on the other side, or I need to buy an adapter
 - (2X) C-MOUNT 1"-32 male to regular lens tube male adapter
   - One of these will be for screwing the camera in where the fiber would normally go during testing.
 - XY adjustable tube-to-tube coupler
 - Lockable iris
 - screw in fiber couple (we already have one, but might want a better one)
 - Dichroic, ideally with the flatest possible wavelength response
